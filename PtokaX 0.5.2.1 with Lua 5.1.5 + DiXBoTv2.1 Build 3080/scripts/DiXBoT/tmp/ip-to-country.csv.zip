<p>The domain of the fashion design due to its grace and glamour has always been intriguing as well as exciting. On speaking of fashion design, it is considered to be a form of art which is able to include the refinement of creating clothes and accessories.</p>
<p>We can trace the history of fashion design back to the beginning of the19<sup>th</sup> century. It was in the 19<sup>th</sup> century that the designs were the product of the dresses worn in the royal courts. However, it was Charles Frederick Worth who was the first fashion designer to launch his first fashion house in Paris. The designs of Charles Frederick managed to influence the people and they were labeled as the designs of the &#8220;House Of Worth.&#8221; It was in this way that Charles Frederick as a designer became tantamount with a particular brand.</p>
<p>Paul Poi Ret was another very famous designer who was able to make a significant contribution to the evolution of the fashion industry by mixing the classical style which was made up of gorgeous dressing similar to that of the Paris fashion. Some of the many other important designers of this age were Vionnet,  Fortuny, Patou, Lanvin and Chanel.</p>
<p>It was the city of Paris which all through the 20<sup>th</sup> century continued to remain as the world&#8217;s fashion hub. Countries such as the US and Britain openly began aping the French designs. After the World War there was an emergence of other countries as the centers of fashion. This is why Paris stopped being the sole influential factor. With the growth of the British fashion industry a new range of street fashion emerged which focused mainly on the young consumers. We can see this by <a href="http://www.nevsmodels.co.uk/" title="UK models">looking at UK models</a> and also <a href="http://ukmodelsreviews.org.uk">http://ukmodelsreviews.org.uk</a> ,</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren">Ralph Lauren</a> and Calvin Klein the American designers rose to limelight with their sportswear. They were able to make it as a style statement. Nowadays, it will be possible for you to categorize fashion designs into two main categories. In the first division the haute couture has been designed for the individual customers and the ready-to-wear collection is the other category. While the preceding is established on certain themes and is considered to be more for constituting a style statement, the second one is meant for the masses.</p>
<p>It was the mid-90s which saw the evolution of a new breed of designers. These are the designers who managed to redefine traditional concepts and looked at fashion from a completely new concept and at the same time they created their own new concepts.</p>
<p>Hence we can say that the world of fashion design has seen a steady evolution over the past years. Fashion is also considered to be the repercussion of the sincere efforts of many of the world’s top designers.</p>
