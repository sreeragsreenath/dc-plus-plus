THE OCXs/DLLs SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS STARTING THE GUI

IF THE GUI STARTS NORMALLY DO NOT PROCEED WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW

IF YOU ALREADY HAVE THESE COMPONENTS IN /WINDOWS/SYSTEM32 DO NOT REPEAT DO NOT OVERWRITE YOUR EXISTING LIBRARIES

If you do not have these two dlls extract them into /Windows/System32 and in Run (Start - Run) type "regsvr32 " and drag and drop the dlls onto it one at a time. Once done the Grimoire should now function properly.
